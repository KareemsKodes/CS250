How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
When a user gives a list of what they would like in a program, we can create user stories which are stories that outline the functional experience that we would have when interacting with one of the items on the list given to us by the user. These user stories will highlight how things should look and act, which will help the tester and developer have clarity on what is needed when performing their duties. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
If I will be working on a team, depending on my role on the team, and what methodology the group uses. I hope that in my future development work, daily meetings are incorporate in my development work. They would be helpful at keeping me informed at what everyone else is doing so I might be able to orient what I have left to do around what others might need. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
I think being a good team memeber means completing all of your work, being communicative with other members of the team, assisting others when they need it, and making sure that everyone knows what I need from them in order to complete my portion of the development.
